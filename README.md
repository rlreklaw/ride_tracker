## General Notes
* https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-applications-spring-jdbc/table-of-contents
* Use MySQL workbench to create `ride_tracker` schema and `ride` table
* Often have to run the JUnit tests twice to get them to succeed.  They usually timeout and fail when run the first time after the server is started.  Success on the second attempt.
